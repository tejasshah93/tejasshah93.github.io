### Implementation Part

As discussed last week, we headed on towards identifying and triggering such events that modify DOM using PhantomJS library for headless browsers.
Also, prioritizing accessibility issues, first we focus on form validations and "on****()" JavaScript events.

# Gist of work done

This week mostly went with familiarizing more and more with [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) library and along side implementing the required. Targeting form validation first, this is what I've been trying and getting around: [Form Validation](https://github.com/tejasshah93/gsoc-code/blob/master/code/phantomJS/formValidation.js)

Basically, it invokes a headless phantom browser and gets all the forms within a given URL. What we do now is submit each of them without filling anything.

Crucial and important assumption is, yes, we assume that submitting an empty form will summon most errors within it. This takes us to the newly generated HTML or in other sense, dynamically obtained content from form validation.  

Our task, to validate this newly obtained via AChecker.
Seems simple here on, right? :)

Well, guess some things are meant to be developed for us! :) I'm trying to design a new timeline accordingly for this project which would suffice the implementation part and integrating with AChecker and so on..

@Stay Tuned! As time passes, the more exciting it gets ;)
