### Excited to be a part of GSoC14 in contribution to IDI

Well, results announced and boom! I was selected as a part of Google Summer of Code 2014 programme as a part of [Inclusive Design Institute (IDI)](http://inclusivedesign.ca/) Thanks to my mentor, [Silvia Mirri](http://it.linkedin.com/pub/silvia-mirri/5/602/bb9) and organization admins as well for their continuous and immense support that gave me this platform to contribute to the Open Source world.

This is my first time for GSoC and I`m very glad to be a part of it. I will be providing on dynamic support for the current static AChecker implementation. Never the less, I shall prove my caliber rightfully and complete the project within the stipulated time period.

As the saying goes:

P.S.: Yeah.. Well, I'm too excited and I've gone pretty blank for the blockquote to be filled. Suggestions welcome! :)

Looking forward for a Summer of Coding, Interactions, Brain-storming Sessions, Implementations, Projections and finally the Desired Product!

@Stay Tuned!
