### Planning of AChecker architecture for dynamic testing

---
# Clearing the fog

Well, as discussed first, we were about to inculcate dynamic testing into AChecker using Jasmine library.
However, Jasmine Library not needed really. Its for regression testing..
i.e. when we write basically some of the javascript functions for ourselves, we can have testing over them using Jasmine

Instead, PhantomJS seems to be promising for running headless browser and extracting elements that modify DOM and trigger them. 

---
# Now, what we do and how

- JavaScript(using jQuery) functions and other libraries to detect the events that trigger DOM events
    - The main task here: To identify the snippets in the code that modify DOM

- Perform such triggers of events and get the new HTML
    - Either get the difference between the new HTML and the old HTML and pass it on to the AChecker Paste HTML Markup function
    Or
    - Again pass this newly obtained HTML for AChecker validation and get the union of the results obtained. 
Thus, the final result of AChecker will be validation of all such pages, and not a single one

- However, the above task requires the site to be opened and events to be triggered. For this, we need a headless browser (a browser framework without the actual UI which renders the JavaScripts and is able to modify DOM). Thus, for this task, we use [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

E.g.:
Consider https://github.com/join (Signout from account if signed in)
You’ll get a form for signup.. Without filling any information click on ‘Create an Account’. The HTML page gets modified
Have a look at [this paste](http://pastebin.com/kcz1imkT)

Here’s the basic diff between them: [Link to Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vo8lHXnnzkcnFLeFhKRnAwdFU/edit?usp=sharing)

### First things first!

As disussed with my mentor, we first go step by step by incubating all the vital functionalities
for e.g. 
    - form validation is one of the most important to review for accessbility issues
    - all the DOM triggering events like "onClick()" and all such "on****()" needs to be tackled thereafter


Thats all for now then.

@Stay Tuned! Implementation phase coming through next week!
